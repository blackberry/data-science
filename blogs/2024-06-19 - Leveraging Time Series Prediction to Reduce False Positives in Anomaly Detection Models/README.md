# Leveraging Time Series Prediction to Reduce False Positives in Anomaly Detection Models

## Summary

The goal of anomaly detection models in cybersecurity is to accurately identify malicious anomalies while minimizing false positives. Anomalies themselves do not necessarily mean something is good or bad but rather that it varies from what we would expect based on typical trends. Thus, most anomaly detection ML models struggle, producing too many false positives that require manual investigation. 

By leveraging time series prediction techniques, we can help reduce false positives identified by anomaly detection models without compromising true positives. This methodology, demonstrated with real-world examples, can be generally applied in any anomaly model.
