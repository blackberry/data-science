# Unraveling the Floating-Point Puzzle: Ensuring Seamless Model Deployment

## Summary

If you've ever tried to deploy a model to a production environment, this may sound familiar: You've trained your model, and it does well on your research dataset. Things are looking really good. Then the engineers integrate it into the product, and discrepancies start appearing on the same data. This is terrible timing because by now, it's time to deliver a product, and you're scrambling to figure out what's going wrong.

If this resonates with you, then know you are not alone. This is a pretty common problem that typically stems from issues related to floating-point precision.
