# Supressing Background Noise in BBMe Conference using Recurrent Neural Network

Video conference calls with many participants expose unwanted background noise when participants do not speak or if the speaker is in a noisy environment. Recent advancements in background noise separation from speech leverage cloud centric processing of audio stream. Our goal is to develop a noise and speech separation solution that can be applied at edge (BBMe app) and even on a browser running BBMe conference in real-time.
With the focus on Privacy and Security an edge solution may address our customer needs in regulated markets.
